# Introduction
Hello my name is Allison Felsheim, a Cybersecurity professional currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Denver. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity from the University of Southern Maine in 2024 and currently serve as a Cybersecurity Engineer at ASRC Federal.

This repository represents my academic journey in developing advanced computer science and programming competencies through graduate-level coursework. Each project demonstrates the practical application of cybersecurity principles, programming methodologies, and analytical problem-solving skills that I am cultivating to enhance my professional expertise.

My goal is to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world applications, showcasing technical proficiency and continuous learning to prospective employers and collaborators in the cybersecurity field.
