# Introduction
Hello my name is Allison Felsheim, a Cybersecurity professional currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Denver. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity from the University of Southern Maine in 2024 and currently serve as a Cybersecurity Engineer at ASRC Federal.

This repository represents my academic journey in developing advanced computer science and programming competencies through graduate-level coursework. Each project demonstrates the practical application of cybersecurity principles, programming methodologies, and analytical problem-solving skills that I am cultivating to enhance my professional expertise.

My goal is to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world applications, showcasing technical proficiency and continuous learning to prospective employers and collaborators in the cybersecurity field.

# Python Programming Projects
This collection demonstrates progressive mastery of Python fundamentals through practical applications including data structures, algorithms, user interfaces, and real-world problem solving.

**Projects Include:**
- **Pet Adoption Matching System:** Interactive matching algorithm with data validation and financial calculations [(Pet_Application.py)](Pet_Application.py)
- **Function-Based Utilities Suite:** A collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python functions demonstrating input handling, unit conversion, financial estimation, and modular design. Includes:
  - BMI Calculator
  - Time Conversion (seconds to hours/minutes/seconds)
  - Unit Conversion (miles â†” kilometers)
  - Currency and Area Conversion (euros/square meters to USD/square feet)
  - Road Trip Cost Estimator
  - Home Insulation Cost Calculator
  - Midpoint Finder (imported from [bmi_calculator](bmi_calculator.py))
  [View full implementation in functions.py](functions.py)
- **Movie Menu Selection:** Interactive menu for a simple movie databse. Users can view all movies, add new entries, update ratings, remove movies, calculate average ratings, and get recommendations by genre or top-rated titles [(movie_slection.py)](movie_selection.py)

# Cybersecurity Applications
This collection demonstrates 

**Cyber Application Projects** 
- **Honeypot TCP Server:** This project implements a simple TCP honeypot designed to detect and log unauthorized or suspicious connection attempts. It simulates a network service to attract potential attackers, capturing connection metadata and payload snippet for analysis. This aids in understanding attack behavior, reconnaissance patterns, and early threat detection. [(honeypot.py)](honeypot.py)
